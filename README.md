# VPAID Generic

A generic implementation of the [VPAID 2.0 spec](http://www.iab.net/media/file/VPAID_2.0_Final_04-10-2012.pdf) in ES6 Javascript. By default, it includes a HTML5 video player that handles playback of a specified creative, an overlay manager that handles click events, and an AdParameters parser that parses a JSON string from creativeData.AdParameters. The video player, overlay handler, and parser can all be substituted for subclasses in the `VPAIDInterface` constructor. 

### Setup and building
* `npm install`
* Build: `npm run build`
* Dev: `npm run dev` hosts IMA-VPAID-Host.html at http://localhost:8080/IMA-VPAID-Host.html

### Extension
The library can be extended or overriden in several ways. `VPAIDInterface` is the main entry point to the library. It implements the required VPAID interface methods and exposes the `getVPAIDAd` function on a window object if one is supplied to the constructor. The constructor looks for an object with the following configuration options:

* `window` - the window instance to attach `getVPAIDAd` to
* `creativeFormat` - a class that is responsible for playback of the video creative and sending notifications about playback events. If none is supplied, `VideoCreative` will be used. It receives the `videoSlot` property provided by the VPAID host. If a class is supplied, it must inherit from `BaseCreative` or `VideoCreative` or an exception will be thrown during instantiation of VPAIDInterface. 
* `overlays` - a class that is responsible for display of user interface elements. It receives the `slot` element from the VPAID host. If none is provided, `ClickThroughOverlay` is used. If a custom class is provided, it must inherit from `BaseOverlay` or `ClickThroughOverlay` or an exception will be thrown during instantiation of VPAIDInterface.
* `parser` - a class with a static method called `parseAdParameters` that accepts the `creativeData.AdParameters` string from the VAST tag, and returns an object of the AdParameters. If no parser is supplied, a JSON parser is used. The output object of the parser will be supplied to the configured `creativeFormat` and `overlays` classes during instantiation in `initAd`. If a custom parser class is provided, it must inherit from `BaseParser` or `JSONParser` or an exception will be thrown during instantiation of VPAIDInterface. Async and Sync `parseAdParameters` can be used. If the function is async, it must return a Promise that resolves the parsed AdParameters object.

By default, all `VPAIDEvents` will be published from the `creativeFormat` and `overlays` classes to the VPAID host, via the methods `VPAIDInterface.onCreativeEvent` and `VPAIDInterface.onOverlayEvent`, respectively. If you want to intercept those events before publising to the VPAID host, extend `VPAIDInterface` and override those methods.

If the configuration options don't provide enough flexability, subclassing `VPAIDInterface` and overriding the required methods is recommended.

```javascript
// Bare minimum usage
const instance = new VPAIDInterface();
window.getVPAIDAd = () => instance;
// this represents the Javascript supplied in the MediaFile URL in the VAST tag
// <MediaFile apiFramework="VPAID" width="640" height="360" type="application/javascript" delivery="progressive">http://localhost:8080/demo.bundle.js</MediaFile>
```

```javascript
// Advanced usage

// Custom video class that inherits from VideoCreative
const CustomVideoCreative = class extends VideoCreative {
  constructor(..args) {
    super(...args);
      
    this.videoEl.autoplay = false;
    this.videoEl.controls = true;
  }
};


// Custom controls class that inherits from ClickThroughOverlay
const CustomControls = class extends ClickThroughOverlay {
  generateControls() {
    const aButton = document.createElement('button');
    aButton.innerHTML = 'Foobar';
    aButton.addEventListener('click', evt => console.log('I was clicked'));
    return aButton;
  }
}

const instance = new VPAIDInterface({
  creativeFormat: CustomVideoCreative,
  overlays: CustomControls,
  window
});
```

See `IMA-VPAID-Host.html` for an example of interacting with the VPAID interface from [Google's IMA VPAID host](https://developers.google.com/interactive-media-ads/docs/sdks/html5/). The demo page provides a string for VAST tag that loads `demo.bundle.js` which is the bundled version of `demo.js`. `demo.js` creates an instance of VPAIDInterface and supplies just the `window` object that `getVPAIDAd` will be attached to. All other options use the defaults (`VideoCreative`, `ClickThroughOverlay`, `JSONParser`);
